# NotifyMe

## Getting Started

Park me is a full stack application written in Angular (Frontend) and Java Spring Boot (Backend) that enables user to authenticate requests, register a vehicle and reserve a parking spot depending upon the parking stop selected.

The approach taken by me is shown below:
* Creating high level architecture
* Creating flow diagram
* Creating low level architecture

### High level architecture
----add image here----

Within the high level architecture, my main focus was to understand what all systems are we dealing with. In my scenario, the main systems were authentication system, parking system and vehicle system. And all these systems were connected to the database using JPA/Hibernate.

### Workflow Diagram
----add image here----

Workflow diagram is shown above. Using the workflow diagram, I was able to highlight the flow of the application and understand which API is needed for the project and the type of API required. 

### Low level architecture
----add image here----

Once there was a proper understanding of the high level architecture and flow of the application, the next step was to create the class diagram highlighting all the low level details need for the application. 

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
